Finance Dashboard - Power BI Project
This project is a personal finance dashboard I created using Power BI. It helps to track income, expenses, savings, and net worth. The goal was to understand money habits better and improve savings.
This dashboard will shows 
A quick version of finance performance: total income, expenses, savings (which include where my income goes, how I save and where i spend)
one page will show how my net worth grew from 10k in 2018 to 326k in 2021 using simple line chart.
one will compares total income(blue bars), total expenses( dark blue bars) and saving percentage

i practiced creating dashboards using power BI, used DAX formula to calculate saving%, expense% and net worth.
